   <div>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Effective: September 9, 2020</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">FlatVPN is a leading provider of identity, privacy and security products for consumers.
         This Privacy Policy describes how we process and handle data provided to FlatVPN
         in connection with your use of our products, services, apps, and websites that
         link to this policy (we refer to these collectively as our “<strong class="bold">services</strong>”).
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">Information security and privacy are at the heart of what FlatVPN values and promotes as a
         company. As such, we think it’s important to be transparent about how we handle
         your information. That level of transparency also makes for a lengthy document,
         but we’ve tried to make it more readable by organizing it into a logical
         structure and by using plain language.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">FlatVPN offers a variety of services, and certain services may process data
         differently, or in additional ways, to other services and what’s described in
         this policy. We note these differences in <a href="https://www.FlatVPN.com/privacy/product-notices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Product Privacy Notices&nbsp;</a> that are specific to such services, in product documentation, or inside products themselves at places where such information is relevant. Please refer to these Products
         Privacy Notices to better understand our privacy practices for each of the
         products.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">This policy uses the term “personal data” to refer to information that is related to
         an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data
         under applicable data protection law.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-2 undefined"><strong class="bold">Who is FlatVPN?</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">In this policy, “FlatVPN”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to the companies that comprise
         FlatVPN that are responsible for your data, which may be any of the following
         entities or their affiliates:

         flatvpn@gmail.com.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-2 undefined"><strong class="bold">Business Customers</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">Some of FlatVPN’s services are offered to businesses. For those services, our customer
         is a business or other organization who may authorize individual end users to
         use the services that it has purchased from us. Where an organization is our
         customer, it may maintain accounts with FlatVPN through which it and its users may
         submit information (“<strong class="bold">Customer Data</strong>”). That organization typically controls those accounts and any associated Customer Data. In this case, FlatVPN is generally a processor of Customer Data and the organization is the controller.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-2 undefined"><strong class="bold">1. What information do we collect about you?</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">This section describes the various types of information we collect from and about
         you. This information is not collected in all situations, but only in specific
         situations. For example, our VPN products only collect a limited amount of
         information. To understand the context in which collection occurs, see Section 2
         (How do we use your information?). More information about some of the mechanisms we use to collect this information, such as cookies, is available in Section 4 (Tracking Technologies &amp; Cookies).
      </p>
      <h3><strong class="bold">1.1. Information you provide to us</strong></h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Account information.</strong> Some services require or allow you to
               create an account before you can access them. As part of registering for an
               account, we may collect information such as your name, username, email address,
               password and certain other information from you. 
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Billing and payment information.</strong> In order to purchase a service, you may
               need to provide us with certain details such as billing name, billing contact
               details (street addresses, email addresses), and payment instrument details.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Identity verification information.</strong> Some services require you to verify your
               identity as part of creating an account to access them. We may collect
               information such as email addresses or phone numbers for this purpose.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Communications and submissions.</strong> You may choose to provide us with
               information when you communicate with us (e.g. via email, phone, or chat for
               support or to inquire about our services), including when you fill out an
               online form, respond to surveys, provide feedback, post comments to our
               website, participate in promotions, or submit information through our services.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong class="bold">1.2. Information collected when you use our services</strong></h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Usage information.</strong> We collect information about how you
               interact with our services, such as how often you use our services, how much
               bandwidth you use, and when and for how long you use our services.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Device information. </strong>We collect information from and about the
               device you use to access our services, including about the browsers and FlatVPN
               apps you use to access our services. For example, we may collect device
               identifiers, browser types, device types and settings, operating system
               versions, mobile, wireless, and other network information (such as internet
               service provider name, carrier name and signal strength), and application version
               numbers.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Diagnostic information.</strong> We may collect information about the
               nature of the requests that you make to our servers (such as what is being
               requested, information about the device and app used to make the request,
               timestamps, and referring URLs). However, our VPN products do not log any
               information that associates your identity with your VPN browsing activity. We
               do not maintain any records that show what you were browsing or accessing
               through a VPN connection.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Location information.</strong> Unless otherwise expressly stated, we do
               not collect your location information based on your device’s GPS or other
               device sensor data. However, we may collect your approximate location by
               calculating an imprecise latitude and longitude based on your IP address to
               provide you with better service (e.g. to connect you to the nearest and fastest
               VPN server).
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong class="bold">1.3. Information provided to us by third parties</strong></h3>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Referrals.</strong> If you are invited to use an FlatVPN service,
               the person who invited you may submit your personal data, such as your email
               address or other contact information.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Third Party Accounts. </strong>Some services may allow you to register an
               account using a third party account (such as a Google or Microsoft account). If
               you do so, that third party may send us some information about you that they
               have. You may be able to control what information they send us via your privacy
               settings for that third party account.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Threat Information. </strong>We receive information from reputable
               members of the security industry who provide information to help us to provide,
               develop, test, and improve our services (for example, lists of malicious URLs,
               spam blacklists, phone number blacklists, and sample malware). Some of this
               information may contain personal data on an incidental basis.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Business Customers.</strong> Organizations that use our business and
               enterprise products may submit personal data to facilitate account management
               and invite individuals to use those products.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">You generally do not have a duty to disclose personal data to us unless
         you have a contractual obligation to us to do so. However, we need to collect
         and process certain information that is necessary or legally required in order
         to provide the services to you or otherwise perform our contractual
         relationships with you.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading-2 undefined"><strong class="bold">2. How do we use your information?</strong></h2>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">We use the information we collect for various purposes described below.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To provide, maintain, troubleshoot, and support our services.</strong> We use your information for this purpose on the basis that it is required to fulfill our contractual obligations to you. Examples: using information about how much bandwidth you use and how long you use our services in order to provide the services in accordance with a plan to which you have subscribed; using threat and device information to determine whether certain items pose a potential security threat; and using usage information to
               troubleshoot a problem you report with our services and to ensure the proper
               functioning of our services.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">For billing and payment purposes. </strong>We use your information in order to perform
               billing administration activities and process payments, which are required to
               fulfill our contractual obligations.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To communicate with users and prospective
               users. </strong>We use your information to communicate with you, including by responding to your requests, and sending you information and updates about our services. We may do
               this in order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the
               communication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with
               information about our services.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To improve our services. </strong>We want to offer you the best services and
               user experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually
               improving and optimizing our services. To do so, we use your information to
               understand how users interact with our services. Examples: we analyze certain
               usage, device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends
               and user engagement with our services (and, for example, invest in technical
               infrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand); we may use
               device and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific
               research to improve our threat detection capabilities; we review customer
               feedback to understand what we could be doing better.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To develop new services.</strong> We have a legitimate interest in using
               your information to plan for and develop new services. For example, we may use
               customer feedback to understand what new services users may want.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To market and advertise our services. </strong>We may use your information to provide,
               measure, personalize, and enhance our advertising and marketing based on our
               legitimate interest in offering you services that may be of interest. Examples:
               we may use information such as who or what referred you to our services to
               understand how effective our advertising is; we may use information to
               administer promotional activities such as sweepstakes and referral programs.
               Note that our VPN products do not use your VPN browsing activity for these
               purposes and we do not maintain any records that show what you were browsing or
               accessing through a VPN connection.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">To prevent harm or liability. </strong>We may use information for security
               purposes (such as to investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent
               fraud) and to prevent abuse. We may do this to comply with our legal
               obligations, to protect an individual’s vital interests, or because we have a
               legitimate interest in preventing harm or liability to FlatVPN and our users. For
               example, we may use account, usage, and device information to determine if an
               entity is engaging in abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our
               services.
            </p>

               information with third parties for legal compliance purposes, see Section 3.1

               Subject to the foregoing, we may share your information if we are required to
               do so by applicable law; to comply with our legal obligations; to comply with
               legal process; and to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a
               criminal investigation, or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may
               expose FlatVPN, you, or any of our other users to legal liability. If we share
               your information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is
               legally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are
               unlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid.

      <h3><strong class="bold">3.2. Free Products Only</strong></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">Displaying Ads.</strong> We do not display third party ads in our paid products. With respect to our free mobile apps and other free products, we may serve ads to users in certain regions. Although the money we make from displaying these ads offsets only part of the costs of making these apps and services available for free, we provide free apps because we believe it’s important that everyone has the opportunity, regardless of their situation, to
         have secure and private access to the internet.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">The ads we display in our services are supplied either by advertisers
         or affiliate networks we have relationships with, or by Google, a third party
         advertising network (“<strong class="bold">Google Ads</strong>”). To display these ads in our apps, we may integrate into them a software development kit (SDK), which consists of software code provided by a third party, such as an ad network.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">We do not provide Google Ads with any personal data about you, except
         for an approximate city-level latitude and longitude which lets them show ads
         which are more relevant for your approximate geographic location. However,
         Google Ads may collect information through their SDKs, such as your mobile
         advertising identifier, IP address, and device information, for the purpose of
         serving you with “personalized” ads (ads that they think are more relevant to
         you) and measuring your response to those ads. If you are using a VPN
         connection, your IP address is hidden from ad networks and replaced with the IP
         address of our VPN servers. Because we do not provide ad networks with personal
         data about you (apart from city-level location), Google Ads personalizes ads
         based on information that they collect from you and that they already have
         about you - not based on information we share with them.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">Google collects this information according to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google advertising privacy notice</a>. Where an AdChoices logo appears on an ad,
         you can click it to learn more about the ad network that provided the ad, its
         privacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from any personalized
         advertising. If you opt out from personalized advertising, you may still see
         non-personalized ads.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent the display of
         ads because that is how we support our free services, our services are able to
         continue functioning if you do use ad blockers.

      <h3><strong class="bold">4.1. About Tracking Technologies</strong></h3>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">FlatVPN uses various technologies in our services to help us collect
         information, primarily on our websites and in our marketing emails. For
         convenience, we refer to these as “tracking technologies,” although they are
         not always used to track individuals and the information collected is in a
         non-identifiable form that does not reference any personal data. Tracking
         technologies include:
      </p>
      <h4><strong class="bold">Cookies</strong></h4>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">Cookies are small portions of text that are stored on the device you
         use to access our services. Cookies enable us (or third parties that we allow
         to set cookies on your device) to recognize repeat users. Cookies may expire
         after a period of time, depending on what they are used for.
      </p>
      <h4><strong class="bold">Pixel Tags / Page Tags / Web Beacons / Tracking Links</strong></h4>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">These are small, hidden images and blocks of code placed in web pages,
         ads, and our emails that allow us to determine if you perform a specific
         action. When you access a page, ad, or email, or click a link, these items let us
         know that you have accessed that page, opened an email, or clicked a link.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined"><strong class="bold">SDKs</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">SDKs or software development kits are software code provided by our
         business partners that let our software interact with the services those
         partners provide. For example, in our free mobile apps, we may use an SDK to
         enable our app to serve ads from an advertising network. Sometimes these
         interactions will involve that business partner collecting some information
         from the device on which the software is run.

         designed to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or
         modification. We endeavor to use reasonably available state-of-the-art network
         and information security standards, protocols and technologies, including
         encryption, intrusion detection and data loss prevention, and we monitor our
         systems to ensure that they comply with our security policies.

      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">We implement rigorous physical, technical and organizational safeguards to protect
         your personal data in our custody, both at rest and in transit, and should
         these measures fail to prevent a data breach, we will promptly take the
         necessary remedial measures, and we will notify you as well as applicable
         regulators of any such breach, as required by applicable law.

      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">FlatVPN may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one in which you
         reside. We do this to facilitate our operations, and transferees include other
         FlatVPN group companies, service providers, and partners. Laws in other countries
         may be different to those that apply where you reside. For example, personal
         data collected within Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA) may be
         transferred and processed outside Switzerland or the EEA for purposes described
         in this policy. However, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to
         ensure that such data receives an adequate level of protection. These include
         implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for
         transfers of personal information between us and our business affiliates and
         associates to which we choose to transfer the information that requires these
         companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in
         accordance with European Union data protection law.&nbsp; You may contact us if you would like more information about such safeguards. We implement similar appropriate safeguards
         with our third-party service providers and further details can be provided upon
         request.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-text undefined">If you change your country of residence, the FlatVPN group company responsible for
